Project Title:Sick or Swim?

Team Members: Hari Sharma, Emma Kruis, Leah Handel, Sana Jessani, Stephen Anderson 

Project Description: 
- E.coli levels at the beaches of Chicago
- Examine their correlation with weather between Chicago and Milwaukee
- Maybe do our own modeling and compare to their results


Research Questions:
- Is beach water affected by Milwaukee weather? (Pull in weather data from OWM API)
- Does bacterial blooms correlate with swim advisories?
- Are bacteria forecasters accurate in predicting blooms?
- What is the "dirtiest" beach? 
- Which month has the most closures?
- Which month is the dirtiest month (most blooms/highest bloom)?
- What year had the most blooms/highest bacteria/worst year?‚Äù


Rough Breakdown of Tasks:

Visualization 
- Heatmap of bacterial blooms
- Correlational analysis between Milwaukee rain and bacterial blooms (scatter plot)
- Bar graph for frequency of beaches with high amounts of bacteria
- Bacteria over the seasons in a ~two year span
- Input chicago location and get it to say the two closest, least polluted beaches
